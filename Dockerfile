# Add sources to `code` and work there:
WORKDIR /code
ADD . /code

# Install jsonalchemy:
RUN pip install -e .[docs]

# Run container as user `jsonalchemy` with UID `1000`, which should match
# current host user in most situations:
RUN adduser --uid 1000 --disabled-password --gecos '' jsonalchemy && \
    chown -R jsonalchemy:jsonalchemy /code

# Run test suite instead of starting the application:
USER jsonalchemy
CMD ["python", "setup.py", "test"]
